## Nodes explained
* _Address_: Contact postal address as it appears in the original databases obtained by ICIJ.
* _Offshore Entity_: A company, trust or fund created in a low-tax, offshore jurisdiction by an agent.
* _Intermediary_: A go-between for someone seeking an offshore corporation and an offshore service provider -- usually a law-firm or a middleman that asks an offshore service provider to create an offshore firm for a client.
* _Officer_: A person or company who plays a role in an offshore entity.
* Agent (registered agent or offshore service provider): Firm that provides services in an offshore jurisdiction to incorporate, register and manage an offshore entity at the request of a client.

## Dates explained
* _Incorporation Date_: The date when an offshore entity was created.
* _Dormancy Date_: The date when an offshore entity stopped being active.
* _Inactivation Date_: The date when a client told the agent to deactivate the offshore entity, which could be reactivated at a later date.
* _Struck off Date_: A company becomes struck off when it fails to be in good standing, which happens when it fails to pay license fees. In the offshore world this is the equivalent to closing an entity, although it can be reactivated at a later date if the fees start being paid again.
