## Nodes explained
* _Address_: Contact postal address as it appears in the original databases obtained by ICIJ.
* _Offshore Entity_: A company, trust or fund created in a low-tax, offshore jurisdiction by an agent.
* _Intermediary_: A go-between for someone seeking an offshore corporation and an offshore service provider -- usually a law-firm or a middleman that asks an offshore service provider to create an offshore firm for a client.
* _Officer_: A person or company who plays a role in an offshore entity.
* Agent (registered agent or offshore service provider): Firm that provides services in an offshore jurisdiction to incorporate, register and manage an offshore entity at the request of a client.

## Dates explained
* Incorporation Date: The date when an offshore entity was created.
* Dormancy Date: The date when an offshore entity stopped being active.
* Inactivation Date: The date when a client told the agent to deactivate the offshore entity, which could be reactivated at a later date.
* Struck off Date: A company becomes struck off when it fails to be in good standing, which happens when it fails to pay license fees. In the offshore world this is the equivalent to closing an entity, although it can be reactivated at a later date if the fees start being paid again.
